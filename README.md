I spent most of day one working on [Mastering Markdown] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), 
The basic concepts on how to use markdown to write my *reports*, *editing* and trying to understand my way around 
[GITHUB](https://github.com/).I also spent some time finalizing the procedures and registration at *IRMA*,(i.e creating the 
account and getting it activated ).

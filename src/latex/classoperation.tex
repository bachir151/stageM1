\subsection{Detailed Description}
operation class Classes are an expanded concept of data structures\+: like data structures, they can contain data members, but they can also contain functions as members.

An object is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class would be the type, and an object would be the variable. Classes are defined using either keyword class or keyword struct. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
operation.\+h\item 
operation.\+cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}

Well, i worked on part of the mini project in the morning,
(writing the [codes] (https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/code.cpp),compilling and executing them).
Then later, i spent some time reading notes about makefile and cmake for the next part of the mini project, which will include compilling these codes using makefile and cmake

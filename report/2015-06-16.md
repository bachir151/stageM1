###TASK1:
#WRITING THE MAKEFILE FOR THE SOURCE CODE
 -Task1 required me write the [makefile code](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/
  Makefile) for the source code [code.cpp](https://github.com/wkyos   he/stageM1/blob/master/src/    code.cpp)
 -Then i diveded the file code.cpp into three files [main.cpp](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/    blob/master/src/main.cpp), [operation.cpp](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/op   eration.cpp), [operation.hpp](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/operation.hpp)
 -I wrote the  [Makefile2](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/Makefile2) for the 
   three files.

#MORE PRACTICES ON GITHUB OPERATIONS.
 -I spent some time practicing more on github operations using the command line.
    -splitting a repository
    -git add/rm commands
    -git push for pushing commits
    -git pull
#READING NOTES ON CMAKE

###DIFFICULTY 1:
-Makefile:2: *** missing separator. Stop. error
 I encountered that error while writing the Makefile and it took me some time to solve it.

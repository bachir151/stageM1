##TASKS:
### MERGING THE MAKEFILE FOR THE THREE FILES CREATED:

For this part, i was required to correct the makefile made from yesterday, i.e merging the          [makefile](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/Makefile) for te two code source, operation and code.cpp on the same file.Using the line command  `make` then  `./operation x y` where operation is the Executable created in the directory and x and y are any two entries of your choice. We will later see the results in   the RESULTS  section. 


###CREATING THE  `cmakeLists`:
 In this part, i read more about `cmakeLists` through tutorials and worked examples.I tried to first create the `cmakeLists` for the codes from the mini project operation(i haven't finished though) which will eventually give me the starting point for the OXYGEN project. 

###RESULTS:
For this part we are going to see an example of the output in the Terminal when we copile the source code from the three files using `Makefile` taking x=9 and y=27

make: Nothing to be done for `all'.
MBP-de-winsy-2:src user$ ./operation 9 27
9+27=36
9-27=-18
9*27=243
9/27=0.333333

```

##DIFFICULTY :
I am still not familiar with the c++ syntax as it's my first time writing any program in c++.This is real a setback for me as i have to consult refferences several times to understand clearly.However, i am doing my best to keep up.

##REFFERENCES:
 - [WIKIBOOKS](https://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programmation_C%2B%2B/Les_classes#Exemples_de_classes)
 - [cmake for beginners](https://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programmation_C%2B%2B/Les_classes#Exemples_d    e_classes).
 - [cmake tutorial](http://www.cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/).
 - [makefile tutorial](http://gl.developpez.com/tutoriel/outil/makefile/).

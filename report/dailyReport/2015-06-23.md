##TASKS:
### MAKING CORRECTIONS ON THE CMAKELISTS.TXT SO THAT IT CAN LAUCNH DOXYGEN WITH THE *MAKE* COMMANDS:
We can build a CMake system that can  generate an elegant Doxygen documentation for our documented source code.Thus,once we launch the make command, Doxyen creates the html files and the required latex files for our Documentation.To our CMakeLists.txt we add the following lines:
```sh 
option(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION "Use Doxygen to create the HTML based API documentation" ON)
if(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION)
find_package(Doxygen)
  if(NOT DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR
      "Doxygen is needed to build the documentation. Please install it correctly")
  endif()
  configure_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Doxyfile.in 
                       ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile @ONLY)
  add_custom_target(doc ALL
             COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile
                  COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen" VERBATIM)              
endif()
```
To generate the documentation using doxygen,  we set option(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON).

###STATIC AND SHARED LIBRARIES
An OPTION is define as follows in CMakeLists.txt:
option(<option_variable> "help string describing option" [initial value]).   
 - The initial value here could be ON or OFF.

At some point in our project we may need to change this initial value to ON or OFF and vice versa.
We won't need to open our CMakeLists.txt every time to reset this value.   

- For example for our USE_SHARED option defined as:
        option(USE_SHARED   "use a shared library" ON).   
        
- We might want to use a static library at some point. For that we have to change the value to ON.
            
Below is one of the ways this can be done in the command line.   

- In command line type(we have to be in the CMakeLists.txt directory)
- ```
        ccmake -D 
        ```

Then a window like this where you can edit the initial value will appear(with all options and how to reset)
      ![Image](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/image.png).   
      
 We can select the option we want to reset and then click enter to set it to the desired value.
 
 We will have to modify the CMakeLists.txt so that it works with both versions(static and shared library). This can be done by adding the following lines to our CMakeLists.txt
 
 
```sh
option(USE_SHARED 
            "use a shared library" OFF)
            
if(USE_SHARED)

add_library(operationlib SHARED operation.cpp operation.h)  
target_include_directories (operationlib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

else()
add_library(operationlib STATIC operation.cpp operation.h)
target_include_directories (operationlib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
endiif() 

```   
  
  
  
  - If it is OFF: it will build a static library and link the executable with it   
  - If it is ON : it will build a shared library and link with it

###FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE DOCUMENTED SOURCE CODES:
 The dummy project source codes needed some improvements.I spent sometime making it look better and learning more about Doxygen documentation syntax.

##TASKS:
### MAKING CORRECTIONS ON THE CMAKELISTS.TXT SO THAT IT CAN LAUCNH DOXYGEN WITH THE *MAKE* COMMANDS:
We can build a CMake system that can  generate an elegant Doxygen documentation for our documented source code.Thus,once we launch the make command, Doxyen creates the html files and the required latex files for our Documentation.To our CMakeLists.txt we add the following lines:
```sh 
option(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION "Use Doxygen to create the HTML based API documentation" ON)
if(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION)
find_package(Doxygen)
  if(NOT DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR
      "Doxygen is needed to build the documentation. Please install it correctly")
  endif()
  configure_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Doxyfile.in 
                       ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile @ONLY)
  add_custom_target(doc ALL
             COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile
                  COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen" VERBATIM)              
endif()
```
To generate the documentation using doxygen,  we set option(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON).

###STATIC AND SHARED LIBRARIES
We can also modify the CMakeLists.txt so that it works with both versions(static and shared library). This can be done by adding the following lines to our CMakeLists.txt
```sh
option(USE_SHARED 
            "use a shared library" OFF)
            
if(USE_SHARED)

add_library(operationlib SHARED operation.cpp operation.h)  
target_include_directories (operationlib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

else()
add_library(operationlib STATIC operation.cpp operation.h)
target_include_directories (operationlib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
endiif()
  ```   
   - If it is OFF: it will build a static library and link the executable with it   
   - If it is ON : it will build a shared library and link with it

###FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE DOCUMENTED SOURCE CODES:
 The dummy project source codes needed some improvements.I spent sometime making it look better and learning more about Doxygen documentation syntax.

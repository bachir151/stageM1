##TASKS:
### COMPLETING THE CMAKELIST FOR DUMMY PROJECT:
I used part of the morning to complete the CMakeLists.txt . To see the code, click [here](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/CMakeLists.txt). Afterwards, i tested my application to see if the CmakeLists.txt works well(see RESULTS section). Below is the un-docummented code for the resulting CMakeLists.txt
```sh 
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.9 FATAL_ERROR)
project(operation)
add_library(operationlib operation.cpp operation.h)
target_include_directories (operationlib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
add_executable(operation main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(operation LINK_PUBLIC operationlib)
```

###DOXYGEN:   
- INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING DOXYGEN:   
I successifully installed and configured doxygen which will be used to produce the documention of the assigned projects.   
- READING MORE ABOUT HOW TO USE DOXYGEN TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION:   
I did more reading to understand the basic steps to produce a documentation using doxygen

##MEETING WITH MY SUPERVISORS:   
- I spent about an our with my supervisors.During this meeting,we set a scheme of work for the whole internship and the  various tasks to be done in a specified period of time.   
Moreover, My supervisors used this time to describe and explain to me what is to be done for the rest of the internship. 

###RESULTS:   
-After writing the CMakeLits, i ran it in the terminal(as shown below).

```sh

   MacBook-Pro-de-winsy-2:tmp user$ cmake /Users/user/Desktop/stageM1/src/

 - THEN   
Typing ``toto user$ ./operation 7 6`` in the terminal gives:   
```sh
MacBook-Pro-de-winsy-2:toto user$ ./operation 7 6
7+6=13
7-6=1
7*6=42
7/6=1.16667
```

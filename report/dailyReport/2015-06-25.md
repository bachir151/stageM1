##TASKS:
###DOCUMMENTING FEEL++ TOOLS:
 The goal here is to document(Using the previous dummy project) the basic tools we need for feel++ and add their documentation into the feelpp-book.Here is the list of the basic tools documented for this part.   
  - [GitHub](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wkyoshe/feelpp-kyoshe/edit#/edit/master/GettingStarted/Tools/github.md)   
  - [Doxygen](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wkyoshe/feelpp-kyoshe/edit#/edit/master/GettingStarted/Tools/doxygen.md)   
  - [Makefile](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wkyoshe/feelpp-kyoshe/edit#/edit/master/GettingStarted/Tools/makefile.md)   
  - [CMake](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wkyoshe/feelpp-kyoshe/edit#/edit/master/GettingStarted/Tools/cmake.md)

###DIFFICULTIES :
The main difficulty faced here is how to integrate the new additions/changes into the feelpp-book in a systematic well organised order.
For example, adding the tools folder (with its files) into the book and making sure every click on any link leads to the desired file/page in the book.

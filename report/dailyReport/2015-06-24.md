##TASKS:
### FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS OF THE DUMMY PROJECT
An OPTION is define as follows in CMakeLists.txt:
```
option( "help string describing option" [initial value])```

The initial value here could be ON or OFF or something else.
At some point in our project we may need to change this initial value.
We won't need to open our CMakeLists.txt every time to reset this value.

For example for our *USE_SHARED* option defined as: ```option(USE_SHARED "use a shared library" ON)```.
We might want to use a static library at some point. For that we have to *reset* the value to ON.
Below is cmake command to achieve this in the command line:

 ```cmake -DUSE_SHARED=ON```
 
 GENERALLY: 
 
 ```cmake -DOPTION_NAME=NEW_VALUE``` 

###DOCUMMENTING GITHUB TOOLS:
 At this point, i was capable of documenting some of GitHub tools as they were useful for my dummy project and eventually the feelpp-book project.
 
 In my docummentation, i highlighted basic features to get started with GitHub.
 
 - HOW TO CREATE A GITHUB PERSONAL ACCOUNT
 - GItHub DOCUMENTATION
 - HOW TO CREATE A REPO
 - HOW TO ADD collaborators
 - HOW TO ADD FILES TO A REPO
 - HOW TO MODIFY/REMOVE FILES FROM A REPO
 - CREATING GIT COMMITS/PULL REQUEST
 - ISSUES AND MILESTONES

###DIFFICULTIES :
My major difficulty was trying to understand how the whole process of compiling feelpp from the source is done.Thanks to my supervisors, it's not a problem anymore.

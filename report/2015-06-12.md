# stageM1
Today's work included presenting to my supervisors a short presentation  of what i have been doing the whole week.
Then my supervisors gave me a brief introduction and layout of the tasks for next week.
I spent the rest of the day learning the basic commands of using emacs editor and compiled/executed some applications on atlas but only inc++ (.cpp),I tried feel++ applications but it didn't work.

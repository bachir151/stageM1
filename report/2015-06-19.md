##TASKS:
### DOXYGEN:
Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D   
 - It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and an off-line reference manual LaTeX from a set of documented source files.   
 - You can configure doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions   
 - You can also use doxygen for creating normal documentation.

I based myself much on:   
 - How to put comments in your code such that doxygen incorporates them in the documentation it generates. This is further detailed in the next section.   
 - Ways to structure the contents of a comment block such that the output looks good, as explained in section Anatomy of a comment block.   
 - Using  CMakeLists.txt to allow the doxygen documentation to be generated with « make doc » when using cmake.For this, i added the following lines to my CMakeLists.txt.
```sh
find_package(Doxygen)
if(DOXYGEN_FOUND)
configure_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Doxyfile.in ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile @ONLY)
add_custom_target(doc
${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile
WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen" VERBATIM
)
endif(DOXYGEN_FOUND)
```

###DOCUMENTING THE DUMMY MINI-PROJECT USING DOXYGEN
At this point i am able to document the simple dummy project codes and use DOXYGEN to produce:   
 - an on-line documentation browser (in HTML)   
 - an off-line reference manual LaTeX from a set of documented source files   
   - This can be done using the command lines
    - first type ``` 
     	            pdflatex 
     	              ```
     	    then
              ```
                pdflatex  myfile
                  ```
 - To see the documented source code files click [here](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/tree/master/src)
 - From the latex files, i genenerated the documentation in a pdf format.
